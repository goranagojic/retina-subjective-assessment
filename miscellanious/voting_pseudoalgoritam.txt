pairs - A list (?) of pairs ("segmentation_mask1", "segmentation_mask2") presented in questions
answers - A list of strings where each string corresponds to appropriate pair in pairs.
votes - A dictionary where key is a segmentation mask name and value number of votes for that image
    obtained by counting of pair-wise comparisons.


input: A list of pairs (segmentation masks) present to the doctors in questions
output: A dictionary where each image is associated with a number of votes

unique_images = GetUniqueImages(pairs)

votes = {}
for image in unique_images:
    votes[image] = 0

# each question is answered with a single answered
# and answers are used to count votes for each image involved
# in voting
for pair_winner in answers:
    votes[pair_winner] += 1

ranking = CopelandVotingMethod(votes)
